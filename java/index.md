**The BlackBerry JDE Samples** repository includes all the samples released in each version of the SDK. The samples are branched by SDK version.

**The BlackBerry Samples-for-Java** repository includes samples from a variety of sources starting with the following. More will be released over time.

# [Advanced UI](https://github.com/blackberry/Samples-for-Java/tree/master/Advanced%20UI) - a collection of buttons, managers and other UI components many of which can be customized, and all can be used immediately in your projects. Supports multiple SDKs through preprocessor directives.

# [Analytics](https://github.com/blackberry/Samples-for-Java/tree/master/Analytics) - the sample app that is provided with the BlackBerry Analytics SDK.

# [Simple Location API](https://github.com/blackberry/Samples-for-Java/tree/master/Simple%20Location%20API) - a library that simplifies the use of Geolocation in your application.

# [Titlebar](https://github.com/blackberry/Samples-for-Java/tree/master/Titlebar) - a library that provides an API similar to the OS6 Titlebar API for projects built with SDK 4.2.1 through 5.0.

# [YouTube Client](https://github.com/blackberry/Samples-for-Java/tree/master/YouTube%20Client) - a sample that shows how to work with the YouTube Data API using the BlackBerry OS6 Communication API.
