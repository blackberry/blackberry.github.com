# BlackBerry at GitHub

This is the official main website for [BlackBerry](http://blackberry.com) projects at GitHub.

## Catalogs

The following pages are dynamic, searchable, catalogs:  

<p>
<strong><a href="http://blackberry.github.com/Community/All_Repos.html" target="_blank">GH Repositories</a></strong> - A list of all the repositories at GitHub.com/BlackBerry
<br/>
<strong><a href="http://blackberry.github.com/Community/All_Repos.html" target="_blank">GH Samples</a></strong> - A list of all the samples at GitHub.com/BlackBerry
</br>
<strong><a href="http://blackberry.github.com/Community/TBD.html">Components</a></strong> - (TBD) A list of all the OSS Components known to work on BlackBerry Platforms
</p>

We will add more catalogs as time permits.


## News

We continuously add new projects and add content to our existing projects;
keep up with the news at [DevBlog](http://devblog.blackberry.com/)
and at our [Community News](http://blackberry.github.com/Community/news/).

## Wiki

Also check out [Community Wiki](http://blackberry.github.com/Community/Community_Wiki.html); although it is still
at an alpha development stage, it includes
[Wiki Pages](http://blackberry.github.com/Community/All_Pages.html),
[News](http://blackberry.github.com/Community/news/index.html),
and
[Presentations](http://blackberry.github.com/Community/slides/index.html).

## Types of Projects

Projects in the BlackBerry Organization at GitHub fall into one of the following categories:
*BlackBerry-led Projects* or *BlackBerry-sponsored Projects*.

**BlackBerry-Led Projects** - These are projects for which BlackBerry sets the direction,
assigning the technical leader, allocating development resources and driving decisions like
the release schedule and key features.
Development in these projects is transparent, and we [welcome contributions](howToContribute.html).

**BlackBerry-Sponsored Projects** - These are non-BlackBerry-led Open Source projects in which BlackBerry participates actively.
Some projects are transient; for instance, after completing a port and upstreaming the changes,
a project may just point to the upstream community.

The majority of BlackBerry-led projects are licensed under ASL2
([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_License), [Apache](http://www.apache.org/licenses/));
but some may use other licenses like LGPL or MIT.  The license in BlackBerry-sponsored projects vary depending
on their goal; for instance porting projects will follow the same license as their upstream communities.

### Other Open Source Projects

In addition to projects at GitHub, BlackBerry also actively participate in a number of other Open Source Projects, including:
* [Webkit](http://webkit.org)
* [Apache Cordova](http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/)
* [Qt Project](http://qt-project.org/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

## A Tour through a Project

We are in the process of defining the exact role that
the [Community Wiki](http://blackberry.github.com/Community/Community_Wiki.html) will play in documenting these projects.
Currently, most of the desdcription of the BlackBerry-led projects is kept in these pages and in the repository projects
directly.

Using WebWorks as an example:

* Top Project [description page](webworks/index.html).
* The master [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) repository at GitHub at [blackberry/webworks](http://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks), including:
* The usual GitHub features, like [pulls](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/pulls), [commit history](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/commits/master), [network graph](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/network), etc.
* The list of [Contributors to WebWorks](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/contributors),
* A Project [Roadmap](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/issues/milestones),
* Defect tracking via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/issues)

### Additional Descriptions

Also look at the descriptions for [WebWorks](webworks/index.html), Native [Components](ndk/components.html) and [Samples](ndk/samples.html), [Cascades Samples](cascades/samples.html), [Java Components](java/index.hmtl) and our
[External Projects](externalProjects.html).
