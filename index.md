# Research In Motion at GitHub

Welcome to the [BlackBerry organization](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations),
the home for [RIM](http://rim.com) projects at GitHub.

Our first repository
was [WebWorks](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/commit/1a7373cb155756fb6be7ccce893d6d790ec10abf),
created in [September 2010](http://devblog.blackberry.com/2010/09/blackberry-webworks-and-the-open-source-community/) and
today, May 2012, we have 56 repositories covering runtimes, tools, documentation, and code samples.
We continuously add new projects and add content to our existing projects;
keep up with the news at [DevBlog](http://devblog.blackberry.com/)
and  at [Community News](news).

### Projects at GitHub

Projects in the BlackBerry Organization at GitHub fall into one of the following categories:
*RIM-led Projects* or *RIM-sponsored Projects*.

**Rim-Led Projects** - These are projects for which RIM sets the direction,
assigning the technical leader, allocating development resources and driving decisions like
the release schedule and key features.
Development in these projects is transparent, and we [welcome contributions](howToContribute.html).

**RIM-Sponsored Projects** - These are non-RIM-led Open Source projects in which RIM participates actively.
A typical example is a port of a component to the BlackBerry 10 platform.
In some cases, these projects have transient goals; the goal of a port is to upstream the change to the main
community and after that the project will just point there, but some other projects may be hosted in this
organization for a long period for a variety of reasons.

The majority of Rim-led projects are licensed under ASL2
([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_License), [Apache](http://www.apache.org/licenses/));
but some may use other licenses like LGPL or MIT.  The license in Rim-sponsored projects vary depending
on their goal; for instance porting projects will follow the same license as their upstream communities.

### Other Open Source Projects

In addition to projects at GitHub, RIM also actively participate in a number of other Open Source Projects, including:
* [Webkit](http://webkit.org)
* [Apache Cordova](http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/)
* [Qt Project](http://qt-project.org/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

## A Tour through a Project

We are in the process of defining the exact role that
the [Community Wiki](http://blackberry.github.com/Community/) will play in documenting these projects.
Currently, most of the desdcription of the RIM-led projects is kept in these pages and in the repository projects
directly.

Using WebWorks as an example:

* Top Project [description page](webworks/index.html).
* The master [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) repository at GitHub at [blackberry/webworks](http://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks), including:
* The usual GitHub features, like [pulls](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/pulls), [commit history](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/commits/master), [network graph](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/network), etc.
* The list of [Contributors to WebWorks](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/contributors),
* A Project [Roadmap](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/issues/milestones),
* Defect tracking via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/issues)
