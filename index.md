# Research In Motion at GitHub

Welcome to the home for [RIM](http://rim.com) projects at GitHub.  

The first repository in this [organization](https://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations) was [WebWorks](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/commit/1a7373cb155756fb6be7ccce893d6d790ec10abf), created during [DevCon 2010](http://devblog.blackberry.com/2010/09/blackberry-webworks-and-the-open-source-community/).  Since then we have added six more repositories covering runtimes, tools, documentation, and code samples and we expect more projects to follow.
For the latest, and an archive of older, news, check [here](news); also see the official [BlackBerry DevBlog](http://devblog.blackberry.com/).

Projects fall into one of the following categories:

**RIM-led Projects** - In these projects:

* The overal direction of the project is under RIM leadership,
* RIM assigns a _technical lead_ to represent it in the project,
* RIM assigns several of its engineers to contribute to the project.
* We welcome and encourage participation from non-RIM employees at any level.
* The majority (all so far) of the projects are licensed under ASL2 ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_License), [Apache](http://www.apache.org/licenses/)).
* We strive to operate transparently

Participation details at [How to Contribute](howToContribute.html).  Note that contributions from non-RIM employees require an agreement like at ASF: [CCLA](http://www.blackberry.com/legal/pdfs/webworks/Research_In_Motion_Limited_CCLA_021811_cl.pdf), [ICLA](http://www.blackberry.com/legal/pdfs/webworks/Research_In_Motion_Limited_ICLA_021811_cl.pdf).

**RIM-Sponsored Projects** - These are non-RIM-led Open Source projects in which RIM participates actively.  In general RIM will participate in the relevant open source community, but some projects may also be listed here for several reasons.  More information on this category shortly.
