We recently added a new section for the [Ripple project](http://blackberry.github.com/ripple) on our main BlackBerry open source wiki.  This page contains information on project milestones, issues, contributors, and the repos that make up the project.

Ripple is a platform agnostic mobile application development and emulation tool. It allows a web developer to work in a browser-like testing environment, preserving the typical edit and refresh cycle, while exposing advanced debugging tools such as web inspector on their application content.
