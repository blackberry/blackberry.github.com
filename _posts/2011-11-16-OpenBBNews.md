We have started a new Blog to report on and encourage discussions about Open Source activities related to BlackBerry, PlayBook, BBX, and similar topics.

The content and format for [OpenBBNews](http://openbbnews.wordpress.com) will evolve over time, but the initial set of 3 posts is typical: to describe how to Compile and Install TunnelTilt into your PlayBook we included [detailed how-to steps](http://openbbnews.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/tunneltilt-github/), but also described how to [Install the latest Developer Beta](http://openbbnews.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/unbox-with-a-twist/) and how to [Create and Install a Debug Token](http://openbbnews.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/installing-a-debug-token/).

The authors at [Open BB News](http://openbbnews.wordpress.com/about/) are the developers that work in these Open Source projects; we are looking forward to your participation via comments, blog rolls, link backs and other links.  And drop us a note if you think your project would be of interest to our readers.
