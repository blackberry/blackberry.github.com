Today we open sourced
[Alice](http://blackberry.github.com/Alice) (A Lightweight Independent CSS Engine) is a small JavaScript library that exploits hardware-accelerated capabilities in modern browsers to implement high-quality, high-end visual effects.  Effects currently supported in Alice include bounce, toss, wobble, spring, fading, rotation, page flips, carousel and more.

Alice is available under an ASL2 license.  We also include demos showcasing the effects and showing how to invoke them.  The demos are also available online; start a modern Webkit-based browser like Safari, Chrome, or the browsers used in BlackBerry BlackBerry 7 devices or the PlayBook Browser and navigate to the [Demo Page](http://blackberry.github.com/Alice/demos.html).
