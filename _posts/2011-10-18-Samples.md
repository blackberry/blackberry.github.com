Today [Research in Motion](http://rim.com) made available 21 code samples, all under an Open Source License, that show how to use the [Native SDK](http://developer.blackberry.com/native) to accomplish common tasks, from handling updates from the accelerometer sensor to using multimedia playback.

For more information, check out the [short summaries](http://blackberry.github.com/ndk/samples.html) or navigate directly to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/blackberry/NDK-Samples).
