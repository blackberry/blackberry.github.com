We recently visited the [Nitobi](http://www.nitobi.com) offices to start work on bringing PhoneGap to the BlackBerry PlayBook.  Everyone had a [great time](http://twitter.com/#!/confusement/status/91405586767413249).  Once we [get it all ready](https://github.com/tinyhippos/phonegap-blackberry-webworks) we'll be sending the pull request back to PhoneGap.
