# Samples for Cascades for BlackBerry&reg; 10

## Cascades-Samples

The [Cascades-Samples](http://github.com/blackberry/Cascades-Samples) repository
has most of the official Cascades samples.  The samples come directly from
the team designing Cascades and are infused with that TAT 'style'. There are 15 samples,
some using QML and some using only Qt.
Some of these samples were highlighted during the [Super Jam session](http://devblog.blackberry.com/2012/05/blackberry-10-jam-super-session-videos/)
([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=szU-8e3OurI)).

## Cascades-Community-Samples

The [Cascades-Community-Samples](http://github.com/blackberry/Cascades-Community-Samples) repository are contributions from the community.
The first contribution corresponds to the demo from Macadamian presented during the
[Super Jam session](http://devblog.blackberry.com/2012/05/blackberry-10-jam-super-session-videos/).
The demo shows how to integrate OpenGL with Cascades ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=3nX_AploVC8)).
